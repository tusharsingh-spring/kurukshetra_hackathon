"""Fall detection state machine.

Rule-based fall detection that emits FALL events.

A fall is defined as the conjunction of three signals on a *single track*
within a short window:

  (a) bbox aspect-ratio transitions from vertical (h > w) to clearly
      horizontal (w > h * aspect_threshold) — a person lying flat, not
      merely leaning or sitting
  (b) hip / shoulder keypoints drop below a height fraction of the bbox
      (body's centre of mass is low)
  (c) the (a)+(b) transition completes within `transition_window_s`

  AND (d) the track was *stably* upright for at least `min_upright_s`
      seconds before the transition — a single upright frame during
      fidgeting does NOT re-arm the trigger.

The window filters slow sitting-down: someone lowering themselves into a
chair over 3-4 seconds should NOT trip the detector, but a person's centre
of mass dropping in <1.5s should.

Per-track state is kept in a dict keyed by track_id so multiple simultaneous
falls are tracked independently. Stale tracks are GC'd when not seen for
a while.

Debug: set env FALL_DEBUG=1 to log every TRIGGER and every "would-trigger-
but-suppressed" event with the full signal breakdown.

      aspect_threshold:     bbox w/h above this counts as "horizontal".
                            A genuine lying-flat fall produces ~1.5-2.0+; a
                            seated/leaning person is typically 0.8-1.2.
                            Default 1.5 (was 1.0 — too permissive, fired on
                            sitting/leaning).
      keypoint_height_frac: hip/shoulder y must be at or below this fraction of

                            hips at ~0.55-0.65 of bbox height). Default 0.75.
      transition_window_s:  max elapsed time from last UPRIGHT to first FALLEN.
      cooldown_s:          suppress repeated FALL events on same track AFTER

      min_upright_s:        minimum continuous upright duration before the
                            track is eligible to fire a fall. Single upright
                            frames during fidgeting no longer re-arm the
